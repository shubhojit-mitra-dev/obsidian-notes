### Introduction
Internships offer a valuable opportunity for students to gain practical experience, develop
skills, and understand the professional world. My internship at Asha Welfare Society from June 1st to July 31st was a unique and challenging experience that tested my abilities, patience, and resilience. This essay details my journey, the projects I worked on, the obstacles I faced, the skills I developed, and the overall impact of the internship on my personal and professional growth.
### Objectives and Mission of Asha Welfare Society

Asha Welfare Society is a non-governmental organization focused on empowering women
through vocational training, primarily in stitching clothes. The NGO aims to provide women with the skills and opportunities needed to achieve financial independence and improve their quality of life. The organization also engages in various social initiatives, including health awareness campaigns, distribution of essential items to the needy, and environmental conservation efforts.
### Initial Challenges and Project Assignments

Finding the NGO was my first challenge, setting the tone for what would be a strenuous
internship. Upon arrival, I was randomly assigned a project called "Size Zero," inspired by a
South Indian movie of the same name, and partnered with Purab Mallick. The project's goal
was to create a campaign promoting exercise to raise funds, similar to the movie's storyline.
However, the instructions were vague, and my teammate and I struggled to understand our
tasks. Our attempts to seek clarification from the NGO mentor were met with criticism rather
than guidance, leading to a frustrating start.
### Project "Size Zero"

The project "Size Zero" aimed to address body image issues and promote fitness while raising funds for the NGO. Despite our confusion, we were instructed to create flyers and posters. I designed professional flyers, but the mentor's constant dissatisfaction hindered our progress. Eventually, we presented our project to an associate of the mentor, only to face the same questions about the feasibility of fundraising through exercise. The mentor's inability to provide answers led to the project's cancellation, and we were reassigned to a new project, "Rashtriyata Abhiyan."
### Project "Rashtriyata Abhiyan"

The "Rashtriyata Abhiyan" project was controversial, requiring us to gather at city intersections and sing the national anthem. This initiative risked disrupting businesses and pedestrians. Despite these concerns, we created flyers and presentations. Simultaneously, the mentor tasked me with building websites for all projects, an unrealistic expectation given the time constraints. After a discussion, the idea of websites was replaced with creating UI designs for mobile apps. Despite having no prior experience, I designed UIs for three projects: "AARAMBH," "MEN'S COURT," and "FARISTE," and shared them with the mentor and Super Lead.
### Participation in Distribution Events

In addition to project work, I participated in various distribution events organized by the NGO.
These included:
- **Sharbat Distribution:** Distributing refreshing drinks to people in need.
- **Clothes Distribution:** Providing clothing to underprivileged individuals.
- **Sanitary Napkin Distribution and Awareness:** Raising awareness about menstrual hygiene and distributing sanitary napkins.
- **Plant Collection and Distribution:** This event aimed to promote environmental conservation by collecting and distributing plants.
### Plant Collection and Distribution

The plant collection event was particularly challenging. Initially, we needed 500 plants, but
arranging transportation required a financial contribution of â‚¹1100 from the interns. Despite
being instructed not to engage in monetary activities, we faced pressure to comply. A
disagreement with one of my friends over contributing led to a halt in the event. The mentor
threatened to terminate our internships and withhold certificates and recommendations. After discussing the issue with the Super Lead, we proceeded with the collection, now increased to 1000 plants. Only three interns, including myself, were sent to the nursery without labor support, forcing us to do all the manual work ourselves. This experience underscored the physical and emotional toll of the internship.
### Feedback and Personal Reflections

Throughout the internship, I encountered numerous challenges, including unrealistic deadlines, constant revisions, and the mentor's dissatisfaction. Despite these obstacles, the experience taught me valuable lessons in stress management, handling pressure, and developing soft skills. The plant collection event highlighted the importance of coordination and teamwork, albeit through a sarcastic lens.

In my feedback for the NGO, I emphasized the following points:
- **Unrealistic Expectations:** The mentor set illogical deadlines and expected first-year
students to perform like seasoned professionals.
- **Lack of Guidance:** The mentor's failure to provide clear instructions or constructive
feedback hindered our progress.
- **Physical Exploitation:** The manual labor required for the plant collection event was
excessive and unnecessary for an internship focused on skill development.
- **Constant Threats:** The mentor's frequent threats to terminate our internships and withhold certificates created a highly stressful environment.
### Conclusion

My internship at Asha Welfare Society was a journey filled with challenges, frustrations, and
valuable lessons. While the experience tested my limits, it also provided opportunities for
personal and professional growth. I developed essential soft skills, gained insights into the
workings of an NGO, and learned the importance of resilience and perseverance. Despite the hardships, I am grateful for the experience and the lessons it taught me. This internship was not just about completing tasks but about understanding the complexities of social work and the importance of empathy and dedication in making a positive impact on society.
