### What is Flowchart?

Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.   
The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”.

### What is  Pseudocode?

A **Pseudocode** is defined as a step-by-step description of an algorithm. Pseudocode does not use any programming language in its representation instead it uses the simple English language text as it is intended for human understanding rather than machine reading.  
Pseudocode is the **intermediate state between an idea and its implementation(code)** in a high-level language.
