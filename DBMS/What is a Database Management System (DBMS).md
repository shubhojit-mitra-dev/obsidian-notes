### What is Data?

Computer stores the information in form of bit/bytes. **Data** is just a collection of these bits/bytes.

**Image** : Collection of bytes (256, 128, ..etc)
**Integer** : Collection of bytes

The above mentioned examples are all considered as data. 

Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc.

Data in its raw form has **no meaning**. But when organized in a certain manner, becomes meaningful. Data needs to be processed in order to get meaningful output.

In other words, **data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself**. Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes ‚Äì which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.

**Processed form of data is called Information (meaningful data)**

### What is Information?

Information is **processed, organized and structured data**. It provides **context of the data and enables decision making**. 

Processed data can make **sense** to us.

Information is extracted from the data, by **analyzing and interpreting** pieces of data.

---
### Data VS Information

Data and information are related but not the same. Data refers to raw facts, figures, and symbols, while information refers to data that is processed and given meaning.

***''Data is the new oil"***

### What is Database?

Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be **easily accessed, managed, and updated**.

Databases, are collection of multiple tables, where data is stored in form of rows and columns. This data is related to one another and hence we call this type of database as **Relational Database** or **SQL database**.

Databases can be **Relational or Non-Relational**, these are also called as **SQL and No-SQL databases**.

Some examples of SQL databases:
- MySQL
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL

Some examples of no-SQL databases:
- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- Redis
